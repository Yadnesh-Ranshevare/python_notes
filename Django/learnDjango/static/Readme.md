# static folder

In Django, the static folder is used to store static filesâ€”files that do not change or require any processing by the server during each request. These files are usually resources such as:
- CSS files (for styling the web pages)
- JavaScript files (for client-side interactivity)
- Images (logos, icons, etc.)
- Fonts and other assets

### need to mention this static files into setting.py
```python
import os


# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/static-files/

STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]       #add this with static:- folder containing static aset
```
