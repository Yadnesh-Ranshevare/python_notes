# static folder

In Django, the static folder is used to store static filesâ€”files that do not change or require any processing by the server during each request. These files are usually resources such as:
- CSS files (for styling the web pages)
- JavaScript files (for client-side interactivity)
- Images (logos, icons, etc.)
- Fonts and other assets
